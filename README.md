This project examines the impact of the legislative success of Swiss Federal Councillors on their decision to resign.
I analyse whether losing direct democratic votes on bills their department was responsible for makes Federal Councillors more likely to resign.
I find that the outcomes of individual direct democratic votes have no significant impact on Councillor’s resignations but that the overall track record of a Councillor’s
lost votes makes them less likely to resign, contrary to expectation.
